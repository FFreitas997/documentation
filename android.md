## Introduction

Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google. It is based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, 
and is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. 
In addition, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Wear OS for wristwatches, each with a specialized user interface.

These include a debugger, libraries, a handset emulator based on QEMU, documentation, sample code, and tutorials. 
Currently supported development platforms include computers running Linux (any modern desktop Linux distribution), Mac OS X 10.5.8 or later, and Windows 7 or later.
