## Introduction

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

Functional Interface

A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. They can have only one functionality to exhibit. A functional interface can have any number of default, static methods but can contain only one abstract method.

1. Consumer: Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result. 
2. Supplier: Represents a supplier of results. 
3. Predicate: Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one argument. 
4. Function: Represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result. 
5. BiFunction: Represents a function that accepts two arguments and produces a result. 
6. UnaryOperator: Represents an operation on a single operand that produces a result of the same type as its operand. 
7. BinaryOperator: Represents an operation upon two operands of the same type, producing a result of the same type as the operands. 
8. BiConsumer: Represents an operation that accepts two input arguments and returns no result. 
9. Comparator: Represents an operation that accepts two input arguments and returns no result. 
10. Runnable: Represents a task that can be executed. 
11. Callable: Represents a task that returns a result. 
12. Stream: Represents a sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations. 
13. Optional: A container object which may or may not contain a non-null value. 
14. CompletableFuture: A Future that may be explicitly completed (setting its value and status), and may be used as a CompletionStage, supporting dependent functions and actions that trigger upon its completion.
